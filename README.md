# PokemonInfiniteTMPatcher

### Pokemon Infinite TMs Patcher
* A tool to modify the Generation 3/4 games to not consume the TM on use like Generation 5

### Setup to get this tool working
* Have one of the following ROMs
  * ----------- Gen 3 -----------
  * Pokemon - FireRed Version (USA, Europe) (Rev 1 works too)
  * Pokemon - LeafGreen Version (USA, Europe) (Rev 1 works too)
  * Pokemon - Emerald Version (USA, Europe)
  * ----------- Gen 4 -----------
  * Pokemon - Platinum Version (USA) (Rev 1 works too)
  * Pokemon - HeartGold Version (USA)
  * Pokemon - SoulSilver Version (USA)
* Navigate to the tab for the game you'd like to patch and select the ROM
* Please be patient when your ROM is being patched. It'll look like nothing is happening, but wait for the confirmation that it's done
* Have fun playing Pokemon Gen 3/4 without worrying about TM usage!

### Note for Gen 3
* It'll appear the TMs are limited, but this is purely visual. Just use the TM and it won't get consumed

### Why not Gen 1 and 2?
* I don't believe they're necessary for this project since FireRed/LeafGreen and HeartGold/SoulSilver exist
* Also, I don't know how to edit the ROMs for those games to support this

### Credits
* Credit to Pseurae for their code for modifying the Gen 4 games to not have TM usage and even making them behave as HMs in the bag
